description: "Conventional perturbation-based extremum seeking control (ESC) employs a slow time-dependent periodic signal to find an optimum of an unknown plant. To ensure stability of the overall system, the ESC parameters are selected such that there is sufficient time-scale separation between the plant and the ESC dynamics. This approach is suitable when the plant operates at a fixed time-scale. In case the plant slows down during operation, the time-scale separation can be violated. As a result, the stability and performance of the overall system can no longer be guaranteed. In this work, we propose an ESC for periodic systems, where the external time-dependent dither signal in conventional ESC is replaced with the periodic signals present in the plant, thereby making ESC time-invariant in nature. The advantage of using a state-based dither is that it inherently contains the information about the rate of the rhythmic task under control."
