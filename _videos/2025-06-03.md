description: "In this work, we developed a quasi-passive ankle exoskeleton with a variable stiffness mechanism capable of self-tuning. As the relationship between the muscular effort and the optimal spring stiffness across different walking speeds is not known a priori, a model-free, discrete-time extremum seeking control (ESC) algorithm was implemented for real-time optimization of spring stiffness. Experiments with an able-bodied subject demonstrate that as the walking speed of the user changes, ESC automatically tunes the torsional stiffness about the ankle joint."
