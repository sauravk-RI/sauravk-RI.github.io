description: "This video shows an extremum seeking controller (ESC) for simultaneously tuning the feedback control gains of a knee-ankle powered prosthetic leg using continuous-phase controllers. We developed a cost function whose optimum shifts as walking speed changes. Walking experiments show the effectiveness of ESC to track the optimum across different walking speeds. See our TCST paper for more details."
